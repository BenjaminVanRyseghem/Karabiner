This repository holds all my configs and homemade setting for `KeyRemap4MacBook`

The generation of the settings is made with

    /Applications/KeyRemap4MacBook.app/Contents/Applications/KeyRemap4MacBook_cli.app/Contents/MacOS/KeyRemap4MacBook_cli export > exported.sh 

as explained [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/keyremap4macbook/FJ6BO5xzBsE/CYUJQTsKCSQJ)
